# TalentFolio

TalentFolio is a powerful yet easy-to-use application designed for hiring managers to efficiently manage information on job candidates. It is optimized for users who prefer a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you're a fast typist, TalentFolio can significantly speed up your hiring workflow!
