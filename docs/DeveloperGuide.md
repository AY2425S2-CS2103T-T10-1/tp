## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g., `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the candidates' data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' (e.g., the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes).
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info">

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save candidates' data, attribute-link mappings and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Filter feature

The following describes how the filter command `filter a/Mayor=CS` is executed.

First, `FilterCommandParser` parses a set of attributes (i.e., the pair of `Mayor` and `CS`), creating a new instance of `FilterCommand`. The procedure is almost the same as shown in the [logic component section](#Logic-component). `FilterCommand` is initialized with the attribute(s) and `wasDuplicate`, set `true` when there is a duplicate in input attributes. This boolean parameter is later used to generate a warning message about the duplicate. In this case, this parameter is set `false`.

Next, `FilterCommand::execute(m)` is called. The method consists of three steps:

1. autocorrection of `Mayor` and `CS`,
1. creation and application of filtering predicate, and
1. generation of warning messages.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the method works at the low-level:

<puml src="diagrams/FilterSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="filter a/Mayor=CS" />

To autocorrect the attribute name `Mayor`, the Model goes through the following process:

<puml src="diagrams/AutoCorrection.puml" alt="Autocorrection of 'Mayor'" />

The attribute value `CS` will be autocorrected in a similar way.

Alternatively, if there is no attribute name/value close enough to `Mayor`/`CS`, nothing will be returned from `autocorrectAttributeName/Value`; this is why their return value is `Optional<String>`.

The second parameter for `getWarningForName/Value` (i.e., `corecctedName/Value`) is also `Optional<String>`, meaning the method can also generate a warning message that no candidate has the input attribute name/value. The recommended usage is to pass the return value of `autocorrectAttributeName/Value` directly as this second parameter.

If there are multiple attributes given to the filter command, each attribute will go through the same process as above. Specifically, the command

1. first autocorrects all the attributes,
1. followed by the creation and application of predicate with the corrected attributes, and
1. obtains warning messages for the entire attribute name/values.

Please also note that, in the actual implementation, the command repeats the autocorrection process during the acquisition of warning messages. This is for the sake of simplicity of code.

### Undo feature

The undo mechanism is implemented inside `Model`. `Model` now implements the following operations:
* `Model#saveState()` - Saves the current `AddressBook` in its history. This is executed before every command in `LogicManager`.
* `Model#revertLastState()` - Reverts the `AddressBook` to the last state in `Model`'s history.

`Model` stores a `Stack` of `AddressBook`-s. To save the current data, it creates a copy of the current `AddressBook` object, but copies the `Person` object by reference. This feature therefore requires that `Person` is not modified in-place when editing, but instead re-constructed.

<box type="info">

To prevent the case where an `UndoCommand` does not change any data, `Model#saveState()` enforces that duplicate states will not be saved. Similarly, `Model#revertLastState()` enforces that it will not revert to an `AddressBook` which is equal to the current `AddressBook`, using the Java `Object#equals()` method.

As `AddressBook#equals()` only checks for `UniquePersonList` and `aliasMappings`, only changes to these will be undone.

</box>

The following sequence diagram illustrates how `Model#saveState()` is implemented.

<puml src="diagrams/ModelSaveState.puml" alt="ModelSaveState" />

The following sequence diagram illustrates how `UndoCommand#execute()` is implemented.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

It is noteworthy that although `saveState()` is called before `UndoCommand` gets executed, the undoing still works as `revertLastState()` ensures it will revert to a different `AddressBook`.

### Sort/numerical sort feature

Sorting is currently done via custom comparators. Due to the similarity between the two sort commands, we have two classes that inherit from an abstract class `SortCommand`: `LexSortCommand` for the default alphabetical sort, and `NumSortCommand` for numerical sort.

First, `LexSortCommandParser`/`numSortCommandParser` parses an attribute name and an optional field order parameter, creating a new instance of `LexSortCommand`/`NumSortCommand`. The procedure is almost the same as shown in the [logic component section](#Logic-component). The instance is initialized with the attribute name and a boolean variable `isAscending`, which is set to `true` or `false` depending on the user input. 

Next, `SortCommand::execute(m)` is called. The method consists of three steps:

1. autocorrection of the attribute name,
1. creation and application of sort comparators, and
1. generation of warning messages from autocorrection and missing attribute/numerical value.

Note that autocorrection in Step 1 and the generation of warnings about autocorrection in Step 3 use the same implementation as the one mentioned in the [filtering section](#filtering).

The following sequence diagrams show how a default sort operation "sort a/Location o/ascending" is executed (the autocorrection process in Step 1 is omitted):

<puml src="diagrams/LexSortSequenceDiagram1.puml"></puml>
<puml src="diagrams/LexSortSequenceDiagram2.puml"></puml>

The process of a numerical sort operation "sort-num a/GPA o/descending" is similar to the above, except for comparator used (refer to the diagram below) and an extra call to `Model::numOfPersonsWithNumericalValue` when generating the warning message.

<puml src="diagrams/NumSortSequenceDiagram.puml"></puml>

### Glossary

* **Attribute**: A key-value pair associated with a candidate.
  * For example, `Graduation Year: 2027` is an attribute, where the **attribute name** is `Graduation Year` and the **attribute value** is `2027`.
* **Candidate**: Any person in `TalentFolio`. May be used interchangeably with the term "person".
* **Command**: A string of text that the user enters via the command line.
* **Duplicate**: A string that matches another string exactly, ignoring case.
* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS.
* **Valid email**: A string of characters of the form `{local-part}@{domain}` adhering to the following constraints:
  * `{local-part}` contains only alphanumeric characters and the special characters `+_.-`, and cannot start or end with a special character.
  * `{domain}` consists of _domain labels_ separated by periods (`.`), where the last domain label is at least 2 characters long.
  * Each _domain label_ contains only alphanumeric characters and hyphens (`-`), and cannot start or end with a hyphen.
* **Valid name**: Any sequence containing only whitespace, alphanumeric characters, and the special characters `()/@-',._`. The sequence cannot start with a special character, and `/` should only be used in the phrase `s/o` or `d/o`.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<box type="info">

**Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</box>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample candidates. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

1. Checking for the default setting of site link

   1. Delete `data/talentfolio.json` and re-open the app.<br>
      Expected: Attributes with the name `github` or `linkedin` have a different color (red-purple) from other attributes (blue-purple).
   
   1. Run a `show` command and click some `github` and `linkedin` attributes.<br>
      Expected: They open (or copy) the link to the correctly associated website.

### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First candidate is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted candidate shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

1. Deleting a person under an effect of filtering

   1. Prerequisites: Some filtering or finding command is applied.

      1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
         Expected: First candidate in the filtered list (not the original, entire list) is deleted. The filtering is cleared.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. Try the following test cases one by one. <br>
      Expected (common in all cases): The app does not load the broken JSON file and clears all the stored informationâ€“the candidate list will be empty, and the default site link setting for `github` and `linkedin` take effect.

      * Test case: duplicated nameâ€“change the two candidates' name to `pochi`.

      * Test case: Non-numerical phone numberâ€“change a phone number to `1234-5678`.

      * Test case: Invalid emailâ€“change an email address to `pochi2gmail.com`.

      * Test case: Empty tag nameâ€“change the a tag to an empty string (`""`).

      * Test case: Missing attribute name/value in `attributes`â€“delete either an attribute name or value, while keeping the other.

      * Test case: Missing attribute name/site link in `urlSettings`â€“delete either an attribute name or site link, while keeping the other.

      * Test case: Invalid attribute name/value in `attributes` and `urlSettings`â€“change an attribute name/value to include `/`, `\`, or `=`.

      * Test case: Empty attribute name/value in `attributes` and `urlSettings`â€“change an attribute name/value to an empty string (`""`).

1. Triggering corner cases for `urlSettings`

   1. Test case: capital `attributeName`â€“change an attribute name to `GITHUB`.
      Expected: The app works, associating the site link with `github`.

   1. Test case: empty `site link`â€“change a site link to an empty string (`""`).
      Expected: The app works, allowing the user to copy the raw attribute value.

   1. Test case: duplicated `attributeName`â€“change two attribute names to `linkedin`.
      Expected: The app works, taking the site link appearing first.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5

1. **Add validation for links associated with an attribute name**<br>
   Currently, the `SITE_LINK` field in the command `link a/ATTRIBUTE_NAME=SITE_LINK` is not checked to ensure that the user entered an actual link. We plan to add some validation to ensure that the link entered is a valid link.

1. **Make error messages associated with an invalid index more consistent**<br>
   Currently, using a command that accesses an index (such as `show`, `edit`, etc.) with a non-positive index gives the error message `Invalid command format!` followed with a description of the command. Specifying an index that is out of range instead gives the error message `The person index provided is invalid`. We plan to make this behaviour consistent, such that the same error message is shown in either case.

1. **Support international phone number formats**<br>
   Currently, only numbers are allowed in the phone number field. We plan to allow spaces and characters such as `+-()`, so that the user can store phone numbers in international formats such as `+65 8841 9716` and `+1 (209) 749-4459`. This may also require us to perform validation on the phone number, to verify that it matches one of the valid international phone number formats (if it contains symbols).

1. **Add validation for the inputs in the `find` command**<br>
   Currently, the `find` command has no input validation, so a command such as `find symbols$*&)123` is valid syntax. Since the `find` command only finds names, a valid search should only involve characters that can appear in names. We plan to add some validation, so that the user can be warned if they are trying to find a symbol that cannot appear in a name.

1. **Allow duplicate names**<br>
   Currently, candidates are distinguished solely by their name. However, as the user manages a larger number of candidates, duplicate names are likely to occur. Therefore, we plan to use a combination of name and phone number as the identifier, since:

      * it is unlikely that different candidates will share the same name and phone number, and

      * if they do, it is likely the result of an error.<br>

1. **Warn on duplicate contact info (phone number and email addresses)**<br>
   Currently, the user can add (or edit) candidates with duplicate phone numbers or email addresses. However, since it is quite rare for different candidates to share the same contact information, we plan to enable a warning when such a duplicate is detected. This will help the user notice and correct potential errors more easily.
