**TalentFolio is an application for hiring managers to manage information on job candidates.** It is optimized for users who prefer a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TalentFolio lets you handle your recruitment tasks more efficiently compared to traditional GUI applications!

* If you are interested in using TalentFolio, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested in contributing to the development of TalentFolio, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
